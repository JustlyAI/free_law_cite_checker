# Outside Counsel Litigation Funding Request

**Date:** May 1, 2020  
**To:** Prospective Litigation Funders  
**From:** Outside Counsel for Thor Equities, LLC  
**Subject:** Request for Litigation Funding – Insurance Coverage Action Against Factory Mutual Insurance Company

## 1\. Executive Summary

This memorandum presents a compelling opportunity to fund Thor Equities, LLC's ("Thor") insurance coverage litigation against Factory Mutual Insurance Company ("FM"). Thor, a sophisticated commercial real estate company with properties across the United States and internationally, seeks coverage under its $750 million "all risks" property insurance policy for an estimated $20+ million in rental income losses and other damages resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and related government shutdown orders.

Thor filed this action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on April 30, 2020, asserting claims for anticipatory breach of contract and declaratory judgment. The case centers on whether COVID-19 contamination and government shutdown orders constitute "physical loss or damage" under Thor's insurance policy, and whether various policy provisions provide coverage for Thor's losses despite a contamination exclusion that mentions viruses.

Thor's case is distinguished by several critical factors that set it apart from other COVID-19 business interruption claims:

1. Thor has "confirmed cases of COVID-19 at multiple properties," providing concrete evidence of physical presence of the virus rather than merely alleging general community spread
2. Thor's policy contains multiple, overlapping coverage provisions that create several viable paths to recovery
3. Thor's status as a commercial real estate company with diverse properties across multiple jurisdictions creates unique factual circumstances not present in retail or restaurant cases
4. Thor filed relatively early in the pandemic, before many unfavorable precedents were established

Thor's case presents several compelling strengths that support a favorable outcome:

**Key Strengths**:

- Thor's confirmed COVID-19 cases at multiple properties provide tangible evidence of physical impact that many other plaintiffs lack
- The policy's "all risks" nature creates a presumption of coverage that FM must overcome
- Multiple coverage provisions create several independent paths to recovery
- The specific communicable disease coverage acknowledges that disease can cause covered loss
- The relationship between the contamination exclusion and communicable disease coverage creates exploitable ambiguities
- Thor's diverse property portfolio allows for multiple occurrence arguments

While New York courts have ruled against some policyholders in COVID-19 cases, Thor's specific circumstances and policy language provide strong arguments for distinguishing those precedents. The Second Circuit's decision in _10012 Holdings_ involved different policy language and a plaintiff without confirmed COVID-19 cases at its properties.

This case presents an exceptional investment opportunity with multiple paths to recovery, strong distinguishing factors from unfavorable precedents, and top-notch, experienced counsel.

## 2\. Case Background

### a. Parties & Counsel

**Plaintiff**: Thor Equities, LLC is a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware, with its principal place of business in New York, New York. The sole members of Thor are Joseph J. Sitt and Betty Sitt, both New York citizens. Thor is a prominent commercial real estate company with a sophisticated portfolio of properties across the United States and internationally. Thor's holdings include prime commercial real estate in some of the country's most valuable markets, including New York City and Chicago. The company leases to hundreds of tenants across various sectors, including major retail chains, office tenants, restaurants, and bars, giving it substantial leverage and market presence.

**Defendant**: Factory Mutual Insurance Company is a company formed under the laws of Rhode Island with its principal place of business in Johnston, Rhode Island. FM is authorized to underwrite insurance policies covering risks in New York and conducts business in New York. FM is a mutual insurance company that specializes in commercial property insurance for large businesses and is known for its engineering-driven approach to risk management. FM is financially strong, with substantial assets and the capacity to satisfy a significant judgment. As a major commercial insurer, FM has a vested interest in maintaining its reputation for claims handling, which creates potential settlement leverage.

**Plaintiff's Counsel**: Thor is represented by McKool Smith, P.C., a premier trial firm with an exceptional track record in complex commercial litigation, particularly insurance coverage disputes. The legal team is led by Robin L. Cohen, Kenneth H. Frenchman, and Alexander M. Sugzda, all recognized leaders in insurance recovery litigation with numerous significant victories against major insurers. The firm has successfully represented policyholders in high-stakes business interruption cases and has the resources, expertise, and strategic vision to effectively prosecute this action. McKool Smith's involvement significantly enhances the likelihood of a favorable outcome, as the firm is known for its thorough preparation and aggressive advocacy.

**Fee Arrangement**: Counsel is currently engaged on a hybrid fee arrangement that includes reduced hourly rates combined with a success fee component. This arrangement demonstrates counsel's confidence in the case while aligning interests with both Thor and potential litigation funders. The firm's willingness to share risk through this arrangement reflects its belief in the merits of Thor's position.

### b. Factual Summary

Thor purchased commercial property insurance from FM in the form of Mutual Corporation Non-Assessable Policy No. 1063282 (the "Policy") for the policy period March 15, 2020, to March 15, 2021\. In exchange for a significant premium, the Policy provides up to $750 million in coverage for property damage and various forms of business interruption losses. For losses potentially occurring before March 15, 2020, Thor was insured under a previous FM policy (No. 1050440\) with materially identical terms for the period March 15, 2019, to March 15, 2020\.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on Thor's business operations. From the first reported case in the United States in January 2020 to the anticipated filing of the complaint in April 2020, the impact of the coronavirus was staggering, with more than 1,000,000 Americans having confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 60,000 deaths at that time.

State and local governments took unprecedented actions in response to the pandemic, directly impacting Thor's properties:

- On March 20, 2020, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker signed a statewide stay-at-home order requiring all non-essential businesses to cease operations, directly affecting Thor's Chicago properties.
- On March 21, 2020, New Jersey Governor Philip Murphy issued Executive Order No. 107, directing all residents to stay home and specifically closing "the brick-and-mortar premises of all non-essential businesses," impacting Thor's New Jersey holdings.
- On March 22, 2020, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo issued the "New York State on PAUSE" executive order, ordering the closure of all non-essential businesses and prohibiting non-essential gatherings. This order was extended through May 15, 2020, severely affecting Thor's substantial New York portfolio.

These government orders had an immediate and severe impact on Thor's operations. Many of Thor's properties were shuttered, and numerous tenants, unable to generate revenue, contacted Thor to inform it they could not pay rent and to request abatements or other accommodations. Critically, Thor has had confirmed cases of COVID-19 at multiple properties and has had to take action to secure and preserve those properties, incurring additional costs.

Based on preliminary information available at the time of filing, Thor estimated it would lose in excess of $20 million in rental income alone, with potential for these losses to increase substantially depending on the length and severity of the outbreak and government response.

Thor promptly made a claim for coverage under the Policy. However, FM has not paid any funds to Thor to date. According to our upcoming complaint, FM's response has been merely to indicate it will only consider coverage under the Policy's specific coverages for communicable diseases, which is limited by a sublimit far lower than Thor's expected losses. This is despite Thor making clear it is making its claim under other applicable coverages that it believes are triggered by the current situation.

The Policy contains several provisions that provide strong support for Thor's coverage claims:

1. **All Risks Coverage**: The Policy broadly provides property damage coverage for "all risks of physical loss or damage" unless specifically excluded. This creates a presumption of coverage that FM must overcome.

2. **Time Element (Business Interruption) Coverage**: Covers lost earnings or profits "directly resulting from physical loss or damage of the type insured" to Thor's property. This provision is designed to protect Thor's income stream when its properties are impacted.

3. **Rental Insurance**: Specifically covers fair rental value of portions occupied by Thor, income reasonably expected from unoccupied portions, and rental income from rented portions according to leases and agreements. This provision directly addresses Thor's primary loss category.

4. **Civil Authority Coverage**: Covers business interruption loss when access to insured locations is "prohibited by order of civil authority" due to "physical damage of the type insured" to property not owned by Thor. The government shutdown orders directly trigger this coverage.

5. **Contingent Time Element Coverage**: Covers business interruption losses resulting from physical damage to property of suppliers or customers. This provision addresses the interconnected nature of Thor's business relationships.

6. **Attraction Property Coverage**: Covers business interruption resulting from physical damage to properties that attract business to Thor's insured locations. This provision recognizes the value of proximity to other businesses and attractions.

7. **Communicable Disease Response Coverage**: Provides coverage when a location has "the actual not suspected presence of communicable disease" and access is limited by government order or decision of an officer of the insured. Thor's confirmed COVID-19 cases directly trigger this coverage.

8. **Contamination Exclusion**: While the policy contains an exclusion for "contamination," it includes an important exception for contamination "directly resulting from other physical damage not excluded by this Policy." This creates a potential pathway around the exclusion.

Thor alleges it has experienced losses that fall within all of these coverages and that FM's response indicates it will not honor its contractual obligations under the Policy.

## 3\. Jurisdiction & Procedural History

**Jurisdiction**: This action was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332 because there is complete diversity of citizenship between the parties (Thor's members are New York citizens, while FM is a Rhode Island corporation with its principal place of business in Rhode Island) and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

**Venue**: Venue is proper in the Southern District of New York pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391, as Thor's principal place of business is in New York, and a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred in the district. This venue provides Thor with the home-court advantage of litigating in its principal place of business.

**Procedural Status**: The complaint was filed on late April 30, 2020\. This early stage provides an opportunity to shape the narrative and legal arguments before adverse precedent becomes entrenched.

**Choice of Forum Analysis**: The Southern District of New York is a sophisticated forum with extensive experience handling complex commercial insurance disputes. While some New York courts have ruled against policyholders in COVID-19 business interruption cases, those cases are distinguishable based on their specific facts and policy language. Thor's case presents unique circumstances, including confirmed COVID-19 cases at multiple properties and specific policy language that differs from policies in other cases. The Southern District's sophistication in complex commercial matters makes it well-positioned to appreciate these distinctions.

**Estimated Timeline**: Based on typical progression of similar cases in the Southern District of New York, we anticipate the following timeline:

- Motion to dismiss briefing and decision: 3-6 months
- Discovery: 6-18 months
- Summary judgment briefing and decision: 18-24 months
- Trial preparation and trial: 24-30 months
- Potential appeal: 30-36+ months

While this timeline suggests a resolution horizon of approximately 2-3 years, there are several opportunities for earlier resolution. FM may recognize the strength of Thor's position after initial motion practice or during discovery, leading to settlement discussions. Additionally, developments in other COVID-19 cases could create favorable precedent that accelerates resolution. Our strategy will include identifying and pursuing these opportunities for early resolution while maintaining readiness for full litigation if necessary.

## 4\. Legal Theory & Merits Analysis

### a. Primary Causes of Action

Thor's complaint will assert two causes of action:

1. **Anticipatory Breach of Contract**: Thor alleges that FM's response to its claim indicates FM will not honor its contractual obligations under the Policy, constituting an anticipatory breach of the insurance contract. This proactive approach allows Thor to seek relief before FM formally denies the claim, potentially accelerating resolution.

2. **Declaratory Judgment**: Thor seeks a declaration that it is entitled to the full amount of coverage under the Policy for its COVID-19 related losses. This cause of action provides flexibility in the relief sought and allows the court to clarify the parties' rights and obligations under the Policy.

Both causes of action are strategically chosen to maximize Thor's leverage and provide multiple paths to recovery.

### b. Governing Law

This case will be governed by New York substantive law on insurance policy interpretation. Under New York law, insurance policies are interpreted according to general principles of contract construction, with several principles that favor policyholders:

1. **Contra Proferentem**: Ambiguities in the policy are construed against the insurer as the drafter of the policy.

2. **Reasonable Expectations**: Courts consider the reasonable expectations of the insured when interpreting policy language.

3. **Burden of Proof for Exclusions**: The insurer bears the burden of proving that an exclusion applies and that it is stated in clear and unmistakable language.

4. **Broad Interpretation of Coverage Provisions**: Coverage provisions are interpreted broadly to effectuate the purpose of providing coverage.

These principles provide a strong foundation for Thor's coverage arguments, particularly regarding ambiguities in the relationship between the contamination exclusion and the communicable disease coverage.

### c. Key Legal Issues

#### 1\. "Physical Loss or Damage" Requirement

The central legal issue in this case is whether COVID-19 contamination or government shutdown orders constitute "physical loss or damage" under the Policy. Most of the Policy's coverage provisions, including the Time Element (business interruption) coverage, require "physical loss or damage" as a prerequisite to coverage.

**Favorable Legal Precedents**:

While some courts have ruled against policyholders on this issue, there is significant support for Thor's position:

In _Studio 417, Inc. v. Cincinnati Insurance Co._, 478 F. Supp. 3d 794 (W.D. Mo. 2020), the court denied the insurer's motion to dismiss, finding that the plaintiffs adequately alleged "physical loss" by claiming that COVID-19 "is a physical substance that lives on surfaces and is transmitted through the air" and "attached to and deprived Plaintiffs of their property."

In _Elegant Massage, LLC v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co._, 506 F. Supp. 3d 360 (E.D. Va. 2020), the court found that "direct physical loss" could include "the inability to use or possess something in the real, material, or bodily world."

In _North State Deli, LLC v. The Cincinnati Insurance Co._, 2020 WL 6281507 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 9, 2020), the court granted summary judgment to the policyholder, finding that "the ordinary meaning of the phrase 'direct physical loss' includes the inability to utilize or possess something in the real, material, or bodily world."

**Thor's Strong Arguments**:

Thor's position on this issue is particularly strong for several reasons:

- Thor alleges "confirmed cases of COVID-19 at multiple properties," providing concrete evidence of physical presence of the virus rather than merely alleging general community spread.
- The policy separately covers "physical loss" and "physical damage," suggesting they have different meanings. "Physical loss" can reasonably be interpreted to include loss of use or functionality.
- Thor can present scientific evidence that the virus physically alters surfaces and air within buildings, making them unsafe for normal use.
- Thor's policy is an "all risks" policy, creating a presumption of coverage that FM must overcome.

**Distinguishing Unfavorable Precedents**:

While some New York courts have ruled against policyholders, those cases are distinguishable:

In _10012 Holdings, Inc. v. Sentinel Insurance Co._, 21 F.4th 216 (2d Cir. 2021), the plaintiff did not allege confirmed cases of COVID-19 at its properties, unlike Thor. Additionally, the policy language differed from Thor's policy.

In _Kim-Chee LLC v. Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Co._, 535 F. Supp. 3d 152 (W.D.N.Y. 2021), the court focused on the absence of allegations of actual physical damage, whereas Thor has specific allegations of confirmed COVID-19 cases.

These distinctions provide Thor with strong arguments for why its case should not be controlled by these precedents.

#### 2\. Contamination Exclusion

The Policy excludes "contamination, and any cost due to contamination including the inability to use or occupy property" unless "directly resulting from other physical damage not excluded by this Policy." The definition of "contamination" includes "virus" and "disease causing or illness causing agent."

**Thor's Strong Arguments**:

Thor has several compelling arguments regarding this exclusion:

- The exclusion contains an important exception for contamination "directly resulting from other physical damage not excluded by this Policy." Thor can argue that the contamination resulted from the global pandemic, which constitutes "other physical damage."
- The specific inclusion of communicable disease coverage creates an ambiguity about whether virus contamination is completely excluded. This ambiguity must be construed against FM as the drafter of the policy.
- The policy's structure suggests that communicable disease coverage is supplemental to, not a replacement for, other coverages that might apply to COVID-19 losses.
- Insurance exclusions are strictly construed against the insurer and must be stated in clear and unmistakable language. Any ambiguity in the exclusion's application must be resolved in Thor's favor.

**Legal Support**:

In _Urogynecology Specialist of Florida LLC v. Sentinel Insurance Co._, 489 F. Supp. 3d 1297 (M.D. Fla. 2020), the court denied the insurer's motion to dismiss based on a virus exclusion, finding that the policy was ambiguous and required further factual development.

In _Henderson Road Restaurant Systems, Inc. v. Zurich American Insurance Co._, 513 F. Supp. 3d 808 (N.D. Ohio 2021), the court found coverage despite a contamination exclusion, concluding that the government orders, not the virus itself, were the primary cause of loss.

These cases provide support for Thor's arguments regarding the interpretation of the contamination exclusion.

#### 3\. Civil Authority Coverage

The Policy's civil authority coverage applies when access to insured locations is "prohibited by order of civil authority" due to "physical damage of the type insured" to property not owned by Thor.

**Thor's Strong Arguments**:

Thor has compelling arguments for civil authority coverage:

- The government orders explicitly prohibited access to non-essential businesses, directly triggering this coverage.
- The orders were issued due to the presence of COVID-19 throughout the community, which constitutes "physical damage" under the broad interpretation of that term.
- The policy does not require the civil authority order to specifically reference property damage; it only requires that the order be "due to" such damage.
- The unprecedented nature of the government response demonstrates the severity of the physical damage caused by the virus.

**Legal Support**:

In _JGB Vegas Retail Lessee, LLC v. Starr Surplus Lines Insurance Co._, 2020 WL 7190023 (Nev. Dist. Ct. Nov. 30, 2020), the court found that civil authority coverage could apply to COVID-19 shutdown orders.

In _Cajun Conti LLC v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London_, No. 2020-02558 (La. Dist. Ct. Feb. 10, 2021), the court denied the insurer's motion for summary judgment on civil authority coverage, finding that factual issues existed regarding whether the coronavirus caused physical damage.

These cases provide support for Thor's position on civil authority coverage.

#### 4\. Communicable Disease Coverage and Sublimit

The Policy provides specific coverage for communicable disease response and interruption by communicable disease, but with a $1 million aggregate sublimit.

**Thor's Strong Arguments**:

Thor has strong arguments regarding this coverage:

- Thor's confirmed cases of COVID-19 at multiple properties directly trigger this coverage.
- The communicable disease coverage is supplemental to, not a replacement for, other coverages that might apply to COVID-19 losses.
- The sublimit applies only to the specific communicable disease coverages, not to other coverages that might apply to COVID-19 losses.
- The inclusion of specific communicable disease coverage demonstrates that FM contemplated and agreed to cover disease-related losses, supporting Thor's argument that COVID-19 can cause "physical loss or damage."

**Legal Support**:

In _Kingray Inc. v. Farmers Group Inc._, 523 F. Supp. 3d 1163 (C.D. Cal. 2021), the court found that the presence of a virus exclusion with a limited exception for specified causes suggested that the parties contemplated that a virus could cause physical loss or damage.

In _Seifert v. IMT Insurance Co._, 542 F. Supp. 3d 874 (D. Minn. 2021), the court found that specific coverage for certain perils did not necessarily exclude coverage for the same perils under general coverage provisions.

These cases support Thor's argument that the communicable disease coverage does not limit recovery under other policy provisions.

### d. Overall Merits Assessment

Based on the legal research and analysis above, Thor's case presents compelling arguments for coverage:

**Probability of Success on the Merits**: Medium-High to High

- Thor's specific allegations of confirmed COVID-19 cases provide a strong factual foundation
- Multiple coverage provisions create several independent paths to recovery
- The policy's "all risks" nature creates a presumption of coverage
- Thor has strong arguments for distinguishing unfavorable precedents

**Case Strengths**:

- Thor alleges confirmed cases of COVID-19 at its properties, providing concrete evidence of physical impact
- Thor's diverse property portfolio allows for multiple occurrence arguments
- The policy contains multiple, overlapping coverage provisions
- The specific communicable disease coverage acknowledges that disease can cause covered loss
- The relationship between the contamination exclusion and communicable disease coverage creates exploitable ambiguities

**Strategic Considerations**:

- Early filing provides opportunities to shape the legal landscape
- Multiple coverage arguments create several paths to recovery
- Thor's status as a sophisticated commercial real estate company enhances its credibility
- Experienced counsel with a track record of success in insurance coverage disputes

This assessment reflects our confidence that Thor's case presents significantly stronger facts and coverage arguments than many other COVID-19 business interruption claims that have faced challenges in court.
