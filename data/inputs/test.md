In Fictional v. Reality, 999 U.S. 123 (2025), the Court addressed a novel legal question. Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), famously held that “separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.” In Imaginary Corp. v. Dreamland, 123 U.S. 456 (1899), the Court considered a dispute involving inter-state commerce.

Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961), established the exclusionary rule for evidence seized unlawfully. Ghost Industries v. Phantom, 88 U.S. 777 (1920), involved a dispute over patent enforcement. Similarly, Zero v. Infinity, 202 U.S. 404 (2018), examined issues of abstract constitutional interpretation.

Another canonical case, Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803), set the foundation for judicial review. Nonsense v. Nothing, 52 U.S. 999 (1850), presented a unique legal challenge. Finally, Mythos v. Logic, 314 U.S. 159 (1971), explored a complex question of rights.
